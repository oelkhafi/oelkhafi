### Research Project

#### ChatGPT Code Refactorization Tool
During my time as a Research Assistant at Stevens Institute of Technology, I had the opportunity to lead a project focused on leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT for code refactorization. This project aimed at enhancing software development processes by automating the refactorization of code to improve efficiency, readability, and performance.

- **Technologies Used:** ChatGPT's API (3.5 Turbo and Davinci Models), Gradle for build automation and dependency management.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Developed a tool that intelligently refactors code fragments, significantly reducing memory requirements and increasing execution speeds.
  - Achieved a 95% success rate in optimizing code performance, making software development more efficient.
  - Implemented the tool as a plugin, facilitating its integration into existing development workflows.
- **Research Outcome:** This project not only demonstrated the potential of AI in software development but also provided a practical solution that could be integrated into development environments to streamline the coding process.
